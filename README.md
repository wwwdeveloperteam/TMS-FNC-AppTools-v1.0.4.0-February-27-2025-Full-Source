# TMS FNC AppTools v1.0.4.0 (February 27, 2025) Full Source

Universal Delphi & C++ Builder components for VCL or FMX desktop application management. Compared to the rest of the FNC family (that is the family of our universal components), TMS FNC AppTools is a little bit different. It revolves exclusively around desktop application development! The reason for this is simple: desktop and mobile applications are unalike and some functionalities/features make no sense or restricted in mobile environments. This way we can fully focus on desktop specific needs.
